Photos shall be uploaded soon :)

To build this app, please clone/fork/download the zip file and extract it. Open in suitable editor like VS Code or Android Studio and build it on an emulator or a physical device. No extra dependencies are needed to be installed. (Works on versions Android 6 and above). For Mac/Iphone users, the process for the build is same and it should run perfectly since Flutter supports both Android, and iOS. Android users might face some issues if I have used Cupertino Icons, which arent supported by some Android phones, I shall update that soon. Stay tuned, please feel free to reach out and improve this app.
